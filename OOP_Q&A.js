//4 MAIN CONCEPTS OF OOP

//Abstraction, inheritence, polymorphism, and encapsulation
//abstraction = hide unnecessary details from user so user can add on to complexity without thinking about the underlying complexity (ex: coffee machine or methods under the hood)
//inheritance = class is able to take on properties of another class
//polymorphism = objects of differenct types can be accessed through the same interface, with each object having an independent way of interfacing (static = methodoverloading(parameters must be different)) (dynamic = subclass overrides superclass which allows developer to override the functionality of method)
//encapsulation = methods determine the data of fields 

//*****************************************************/

//ADVANTAGES OF OOP

//objects are isolated from another which allows you to pinpoint breaks in the code and fix them systematically
//also can modify existing objects or create new ones without affecting other parts of the app
//Dry and reusable code

//*****************************************************/

//PROCEDURAL VS. OOP 

//procedral is functions first approach then data where OOP is data first then functions or action
//OOP uses data structures to encapsulate and prioritize the states and behaviors of objects so that you can control data flow 

//*****************************************************/

//CLASS VS. OBJECT 

//class the blueprint where the object is made up of the data from that blueprint
//each object has its own qualities and behaviors based on its class

//*****************************************************/

//IS-A VS HAS-A

//is-a has to do with class inheritance (ex. cat (child class) is a animal (parent class). Cat extends class of animal)
//has-a relates to the composition which produces instances of references to other objects. 

//*****************************************************/

//STRUCTURE VS. CLASS

//When you look at the access type of a structure and class, it's easier to see how they differ. A structure is public by default and only used when grouping data, while the access type of a class is automatically private and has more uses, including data grouping and other methods. Classes can encapsulate and inherit data and need strict validation.
